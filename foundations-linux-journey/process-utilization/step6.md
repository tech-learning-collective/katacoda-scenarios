In addition to CPU monitoring and I/O monitoring you can monitor your memory usage with **vmstat**

```

pete@icebox:~$ vmstat
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st
 1  0      0 396528  38816 384036    0    0     4     2   38   79  0  0 99  0  0

```

The fields are as follows:

**procs**
* r - Number of processes for run time
* b - Number of processes in uninterruptible sleep

**memory**
* swpd - Amount of virtual memory used
* free - Amount of free memory
* buff - Amount of memory used as buffers
* cache - Amount of memory used as cache

**swap**
* si - Amount of memory swapped in from disk
* so - Amount of memory swapped out to disk

**io**
* bi - Amount of blocks received in from a block device
* bo - Amount of blocks sent out to a block device

**system**
* in - Number of interrupts per second
* cs - Number of context switches per second

**cpu**
* us - Time spent in user time
* sy - Time spent in kernel time
* id - Time spent idle
* wa - Time spent waiting for IO

## Exercise

Look at your memory usage with `vmstat`.
