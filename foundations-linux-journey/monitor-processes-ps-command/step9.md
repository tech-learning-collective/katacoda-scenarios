Let's take a look at the ps aux command again:

```
$ ps aux
```

In the STAT column, you'll see lots of values. A linux process can be in a number of different states. The most common state codes you'll see are described below:

* R: running or runnable, it is just waiting for the CPU to process it
* S: Interruptible sleep, waiting for an event to complete, such as input from the terminal
* D: Uninterruptible sleep, processes that cannot be killed or interrupted with a signal, usually to make them go away you have to reboot or fix the issue
* Z: Zombie, we discussed in a previous lesson that zombies are terminated processes that are waiting to have their statuses collected
* T: Stopped, a process that has been suspended/stopped

## Exercise

Take a look at the running processes on your system and check out their process states.

>>Q1: What STAT code is used to represent an uninterruptible sleep? <<
=== D
