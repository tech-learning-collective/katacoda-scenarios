The `dd` tool is super useful for converting and copying data. It reads input from a file or data stream and writes it to a file or data stream. Since it's a relatively old tool, `dd` particularly useful when dealing with low-level aspects of a system directly, such as whole disks, disk images, or other storage devices in their entirety without consideration for higher-level constructs such as the files on those devices.

You can think of `dd` as short for "disk dump," but the true [historical origins of the name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_%28Unix%29#History) are more muddied.

Consider the following command: 

```
$ dd if=/home/pete/backup.img of=/dev/sdb bs=1024
```

This command is copying the contents of `backup.img` to `/dev/sdb`. It will copy the data in blocks of `1024` bytes until there is no more data to be copied. 

* `if=file` - Input file, read from a file instead of standard input
* `of=file` - Output file, write to a file instead of standard output
* `bs=bytes` - Block size, it reads and writes this many bytes of data at a time. You can use different size metrics by denoting the size with a `k` for kilobyte, `m` for megabyte, etcetera, so 1024 bytes is `1k`
* `count=number` - Number of blocks to copy.

You will see some `dd` commands that use the `count` option, usually with `dd` if you want to copy a file that is 1 megabyte, you'll usually want to see that file as 1 megabyte when it's done being copied. Let's say you run the following command: 

```
$ dd if=/home/pete/backup.img of=/dev/sdb bs=1M count=2
```

Our backup.img file is 10M, however, we are saying in this command to copy over 1M 2 times, so only 2M is being copied, leaving our copied data incomplete. The `count` option can come in handy in many situations, but if you are just copying over data, you can pretty much omit `count` and even `bs` for that matter. If you really want to optimize your data transfers, then you'll want to start using those options.

`dd` is extremely powerful, you can use it to make backups of anything, including whole disk drives, restoring disks images, and more. Be careful, that powerful tool can come at a price if you aren't sure what you are doing.

## Exercise

Use the `dd` command to make a backup of your drive and set the output to a `.img` file.
