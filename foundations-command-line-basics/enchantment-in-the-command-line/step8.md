I gave you a bunch of commands, and introduced a bunch of new things. It&rsquo;s not expected for you to remember all of them, but my hope is this experience (and your place) will last. But I want to show you two last, crucial things.

The first command you typed was `ls`, and I gave just a quick description of what this command means and what it could do. But the full description is here for you too.

Type `man ls`{{execute}} and hit <kbd>enter</kbd>.

This is the "manual page" for the `ls` command. You can find an explanation of virtually every command you could type by putting `man` in front of it. At the top, you may see this is the &ldquo;BSD manual&rdquo; or a bit about &ldquo;User Commands&rdquo; and it shows `LS(1)`. The `1` means we are in the &ldquo;first&rdquo; *section* of the manual. There are a number of sections, typically seven to eight or so on different kinds of computer systems. The metaphor of this just delights me. Not only is there a world of chants and invocations living behind the visual layer of your computer, but this world contains an infinitely huge manual, or grimoire, with terse details of every invocation neatly organized into their proper page and section. It&rsquo;s been there the whole time, just waiting for you to ask about it. All of this has been waiting.
